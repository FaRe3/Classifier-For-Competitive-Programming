Took the source code from code chefs.
Extracted the the feature mentioned in query file using xml code then convert it into csv file using the pyhton code.
Applied Random Forest model.
In this model we are classfying between the following algorithms: 1) Dynamic Programming
                                                                  2) Binary Search Tree
                                                                  3) Greedy
